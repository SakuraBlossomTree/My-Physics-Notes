## Drag force

Here $F_d$ is the drag force.

-  $F_d \propto$ **Density**
-  $F_d \propto$ **Area of the Object**
-  $F_d \propto$ **velocity and object)$^2$**
-  $F_d \propto$ **Coefficient of Drag**

The drag force is given by:

$$
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho A V^2 C_d
$$

where:
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $A$ is the reference area,
- $V$ is the velocity,
- $C_d$ is the coefficient of drag.

Reynolds number formula:

$$
R = \frac{\rho v l}{\mu}
$$

where:
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $v$ is the velocity of the object,
- $l$ is the characteristic length,
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.

## Terminal Velocity

$$
F_d = Gravity
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2} C_d \rho A V^2 = mg
$$

$$
V_t = \sqrt\frac{2mg}{C_dA\rho}
$$

where:

- $V_t$ is the terminal velocity
- $m$ is the mass of the object,
- $g$ is the gravitional velocity,
- $C_d$ is the coefficient of drag.
- $A$ is the reference area,
- $\rho$  is the fluid density,
